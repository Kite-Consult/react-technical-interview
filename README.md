# React exercise
Short exercise for front-end technical interviews based on React.

This repository has been initialized with the following tools:

* `create-react-app`
* `react-router-dom`
* `react-redux`
* `typescript`

The app renders a single 'view' component (src/components/HomeView) as a starting point.

Instructions are provided 15 minutes before the interview call.
